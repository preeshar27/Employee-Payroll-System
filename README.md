# Employee-Payroll-System

The Payroll System was the final project I had to do at my Co-op Placement at Computer Support experts; which combined all the knowledge I had gained in the past months and resulted in a program, that makes payroll for each employee working at the company based on the number of hours they worked, the rate. The data for the employees is retrieved from a database, and each pay entry is stored as well. The link of the web application can be found in a file called 'website' in this repository. It is a dummy version with made up employees, as the real one is currently in use, so feel free to play around.
